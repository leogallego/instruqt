üóÉÔ∏è NetBox
===

NetBox and the Ansible Automation Platform are two of the most powerful tools available for modern network automation. NetBox serves as a Network Source of Truth (NSoT) which is a representation of the intended configuration and state of the devices, connections, and services of the network. It captures the intended state, which is different than the operational state. It uses a structured, cohesive, comprehensive data model for network intent, that forces completeness and correctness in design, planning, configuration management and operations.

We already configured NetBox as a Source of Truth in our previous exercise, and now we will integrate it with Event-Driven Ansible. By sending event data from NetBox to Ansible Automation Platform we can unlock the potential for dynamic, event-driven network automation. Instead of waiting for scheduled tasks or manual intervention, Event-Driven Ansible (EDA) reacts to real-time triggers, such as a new device being added to NetBox or a change being approved and a branch being merged.
