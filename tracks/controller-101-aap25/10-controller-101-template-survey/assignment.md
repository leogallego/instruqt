üìë Bonus track: Job Template with a Survey
===

In this challenge, we will explore the **Survey** feature, which allows us to input a variable at runtime when we execute our **Job Template** (playbook), making it possible to change a parameter or setting at each run. We will be changing the index.html we deployed previously for a new one, so you can see the results in real time.

1. Click the **Templates** link in the **Automation Execution** section of the sidebar
2. Click the **Create template** dropdown button and select **Create job template**
3. **Name** the Job Template as `Install Apache with Survey`
4. For the **Job Type** field, leave the default: **Run**
5. For the **Inventory** field, select `Lab-Inventory` from the dropdown
6. For the **Project** field, select `Apache playbooks` from the dropdown
7. For the **Playbook**  field, you will notice that the dropdown it's auto populated with all the playbooks available in the **Project** repository we selected. Choose the `apache_template.yml` playbook.
8. For the **Credentials** field,  select `lab-credentials` from the dropdown and click outside the box to save.
9. Tick the **Privilege escalation** checkbox at the bottom
10. Leave all the other fields the same and click the blue **Create job template** at the bottom.

‚òëÔ∏è Task 2 - Create the Survey for the Job Template

1. Once the **Job Template** is saved, you should be taken to the *Details* tab of it
2. Look for the **Survey** tab and click on it.
3. Click the **Create survey question** button
4. In the **Question** field, enter `What is your name, fellow student?`
5. In the **Description** field, enter `Enter your name or nickname to see it works!`
6. In the **Answer variable name**, enter `student_name`
7. Leave the **Answer type** as is, `text`
8. Make sure **Required** is **NOT** ticked.
9. Leave minimum and maximum lengh as they are.
10. In the **Default answer** type `Skippy`
11. Press the **Create survey question** button at the bottom
12.  Now the **Survey** tab should show a list with the one we created
13.  Notice there is a toggle that reads **Survey disabled**, next to the *Create survey question* button now.
14. Click the toggle  to **Enable** the survey


‚òëÔ∏è Task 3 - Launch the new Template
===

1. Click the **Launch template** button at the top of the "Install Apache with Survey" Job Template screen
2. Delete Skippy from the **What is your name, fellow student?** field and enter your name
3. Click the **Next** button
